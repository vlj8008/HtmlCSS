	<div style="color:blue">Kombucha has been drunk for many centuries, and safely brewed at home. </div>
	
	<div style="color: red"><h3> Warning</h3>
	<br>
	However brewing at home does have some drawbacks, such as not knowing the alcohol content of the brew. I am here to change that, so please follow my instructions to the letter. Any deviations may result in a highly alcholic brew which also negates the health benefits. 
	</div>
	<p> In my e-book I show you not only how to make non-alcoholic Kombucha, but also how to increase the nutrition value of your brew - specifically the vitamin B content. I will show you how to make an extremely healthy (and delicious) drink. </p>
